The Joint School Mathematics Hunt is around the corner
Don't lose your chance to share your mathematical and analytical skills with others
Feel free to find Wayne Leung 5F (17) (63381091) to sign up
Chances come and go, the ones who catch it, laud, the ones who miss it, mourn, such is the way of life
