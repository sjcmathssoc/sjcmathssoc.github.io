1st Feb(Sun) will be the 140th Anniversary Grand Open Day of St Joseph's College. This year, SJC Mathematics Society and SJC Science Society jointly present you our club stall The Labyrinth, which will be held in AV room (Charles Kao's Room) and Junior Chemistry Lab.
The Labyrinth is a room escape game which requires participants to solve the mystery and escape from the backroom by opening the lock of the door. There will be totally 4 rooms, each room with different challenges, including some fascinating mathematics questions and science questions that needed to be solve. Participants will be given 40 minutes to solve the mystery and escape from every room. Winners will be awarded with mysterious gifts. 
Beside from The Labyrinth, Mathematics Society will be also projecting different interesting mathematics challenging questions on the screen, participants who could answer the questions correctly may be also awarded.
Escape the room may not be a new game, yet it is certainly impossible to find a game that combines mathematics and science together with room escape now in the market. This is surely a game that is once in a life time and you would not want to miss it. See you on Feb 1 in AV room! ðŸ™‚
