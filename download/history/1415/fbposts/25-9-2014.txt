The golden ratio has always been one of the most sacred divine numbers in the mathematics world. The application of it is very broad, ranging from spiral on a shell, to human genome DNA, all of them manifest the beauty of golden ratio. One of the most renowned example, as stated in the Da Vinci Code, is that the proportion of upper arm to hand and forearm is in about the same ratio as 1: φ.
φ = (1+√5)/2 = 1.6180339887
The golden ratio also has some interesting properties in mathematics. In fact, it is always discussed together with the famous Fibonacci Sequence. 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 … You may not know the name of the sequence but you must have seen it before. The 3rd term of the sequence equals to the sum of the 1st and 2nd term. The mysterious part of the sequence is that as the sequence goes on and on, the ratio between the former and latter term will slowly approaches to φ!!
