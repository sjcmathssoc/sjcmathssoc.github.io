3/14/15 9:26:53 will be epic.
Why?
3.141592653 = Ï€
Apart from being the White Valentine's Day, March 14 has been given another role. Mathematicians have declared  March 14 as Pi Day since 3, 1, and 4 are the first three significant digits of Ï€ in decimal form. This year's Pi Day is particularly unique, since a sequential time will occur on 3/14/15 at 9:26:53, representing the first 10 digits of Ï€.
Needless to say, Ï€ has been applied in many fields of mathematics and has caused significant influence on the mathematical development. Thus, Pi Day has been celebrated by lovers of mathematics all over the world. People will eat and throw pies, and discuss the significance of Ï€.  Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has often mailed its application decision letters to prospective students for delivery on Pi day. And it is interesting to note that Albert Einstein's birthday is also March 14.
This year, the Mathematics Society celebrates Pi Day by giving out pizza. Students and teachers can purchase pizza in Room 8 (the classroom next to 6F) during lunch time on March 13 (Fri).
Enjoy the pizza and have fun. One does not simply miss a great event like this ðŸ˜‰.
