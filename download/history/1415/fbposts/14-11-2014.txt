Mathematics might be boring and useless to you, as in our daily lives, you might think we only use simple mathematics that we had learnt before primary 6. There are actually many mathematical and logical-related games and toys in which you will find lots of fun! 
For example, Sudoku (give a try when you see a Sudoku in the free newspaper you get every morning 😃), Klotski (like華容道, a challenging sliding block puzzle), Chinese rings (九連環, A toy which requires the separation of a ‘sword’ locked in a ‘maze’ of 9 rings), Burr puzzle (魯班鎖, Another difficult interlocking puzzle) etc. In particular, there is a quite popular 3-D combination toy involving mathematical theories: the Rubik’s cube!
Rubik’s cube (3*3*3) is a cube in which the 26 subcubes on the outside are internally hinged in such a way that rotation (by a quarter turn in either direction or a half turn) is possible in any plane of cubes. Invented in the 1970s by the Hungarian Ernő Rubik, there have been millions of copies sold worldwide over the next decade. The number of possible positions of Rubik's cube is, astonishingly:
= 43,252,003,274,489,856,000clearclearclearclear!
The Rubik’s cube involves in group theory and permutations, which are quite advanced mathematics. Get a Rubik’s cube now with only about 0 at a nearby shop and try to find out the key on our own!
