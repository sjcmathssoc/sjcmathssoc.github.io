1.414213562373......  Whenever we are working on questions about trigonometry, square roots etc., this never-ending and non-recurring number keeps appearing on our calculators.
The (principal) square root of 2, also known as the Pythagoras' constant, is equal to the length of the hypotenuse of a triangle with legs of length 1.  When multiplied by itself, the result is 2.
Apart from letting us not to write down an infinitely long number when we got sin 45 degrees as an answer, do you know what practical usage does root 2 have?
One usage in real life is the ratio of the A-series paper.  Take out a piece of A4 paper and measure its length and width.  You will find that the ratio is approximately 1 : root 2.  Fold it in half to get a piece of A5 paper.  Measure again.  You will find the same ratio.
Why is it?  With some calculations, the ratio 1 : root 2 is actually the only ratio that allows the paper to keep the same ratio between length and width after being folded in half.  This ratio applies to all A-series paper.
Like the previous constant we introduced, e, root 2 is also an irrational number.  Can you find a way to prove its irrational property?
