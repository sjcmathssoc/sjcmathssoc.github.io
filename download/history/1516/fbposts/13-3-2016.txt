Do you know what is so special about 14/3? Do the numbers 3, 1, 4 sound familiar to you? In fact, 3, 1 and 4 are the first 3 significant figures of pi, one of the most well-known mathematical constants. Because of this, 14/3 is regarded as the Pi day.
In order to celebrate the Pi day, the Mathematics Society is going to sell pizza from Paisanoâ€™s pizzeria at room 8(next to 5E) during lunchtime on 14 March(Mon). For Maths society members, the price will be $24 per slice and for non-members, the price will be $28. All students are welcome. Join us and enjoy the pizza ðŸ˜ƒ 
Pi is used to calculate the area or volume of figures that are related to circles. For example, the volume of a sphere is given by the formula V=4/3*pi*r^3, where r is the radius of the sphere. Moreover, pi is also useful in physics. It appears in the Coulombâ€™s law, which describes the force between electrically charged particles.
